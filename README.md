# frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
  ===============================

This game is a clone based on the classic arcade game **Frogger**. The starter code was provided by Udacity.com as part of the frontend-nanoedegree project#3. The only changes that I've made were on the app.js file.

## Run Instructions

To run the game, simply clone this repository to your local directory, and open the index.html file in your browser. The game will start automatically.

## How to Play

Using the arrow keys, guide the Runner across the cobblestone path and reach the water without colliding with any of the enemies. If you collide with an enemy, the game will restart. If you reach the water, you win and the game will restart.

## Contributing

This repository is in the process of being reviewed for completion credit as part of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests until I have received instructor feedback and completed this project
